            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>What is a resume submission portal?</h4>
            <p><b>Students</b>
                <br>The resume submission portal is a portal where students can upload resume to get advices from Tech Career Days volunteers. Approved resumes will be available for employers to view before the event, hence allowing students to get contacted by employers before the event. The rules(do not apply to freelancers) can be found <a href="{{ page.resume_link }}">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Employers</b>
                <br>After the resume submission portal is open, all employers will be able to view pre-screened students' resumes to find suitable canditates and contact them before the event.</p>
            <h4>What's the target audience?</h4>
            <p>From what we learn earlier this year, we are expecting to see about 600-700 students, mainly but not limited to penultimate and final year students pursuing a degree in computer science. We do welcome others from diploma, postgraduate in IT, as well as students from other faculties to check out this event. Detailed statistics and breakdowns are available in our proposal.</p>
            <h4>What are the activities in this event?</h4>
            <p>- Students-employers interaction
                <br> - Networking lunch (get-together session where lecturers, committees and employers sit together and have discussion)
                <br> - On-the-spot interviews
                <br> - Resume clinics
                <br> - Lucky draws
                
            <h4>How much is the admission fee ?</h4>
            <p>It's free of charge for students. However, we do charge minimum fees for employers. Tech Career Days is a 100% non-profit student-run event. As such, we will need your help and contribution to make this event possible.</p>
            <h4>What would happen should there be excess in the contribution from sponsorships?</h4>
            <p>If there are any, we will channel the excess to fund our future workshops, tech talks, codelabs, barcamps, and many more tech-related events.</p>
